<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
The following series of assignment will demonstrate how to interact with a Node.js server and database. 
We begin with a mock(fake) server.js which returns a JSON object. Later, we'll replace JSON with a database, and 
introduce asynchronous programming. 

<h2>ASSIGNMENT:</h2>
1. Create a file called "logPatientsLastAppointment.js" 
2. This file should call server.js' getPatients() function.
2. The patient data returned is unsanitized, so you'll need to sanitize it.
3. For each patient, identify the last appointment they had.
4. Log the patient's name and the date of the last appointment.
